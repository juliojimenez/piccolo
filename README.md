# piccolo

piccolo is a simple CLI Gopher client written in Common Lisp.

## Installation

Download a [release](https://github.com/juliojimenez/piccolo/releases) (recommended)

```bash
wget https://github.com/juliojimenez/piccolo/archive/refs/tags/v0.0.3.tar.gz -O piccolo.tar.gz
tar -xvzf piccolo.tar.gz
```

Clone the repository (may be unstable)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliojimenez/piccolo
```

piccolo requires QuickLisp in order to install dependencies. You can check by using `make ql-check`.

```bash
make ql-check
Quicklisp is missing. Run make ql-install.
```

To install QuickLisp, run `make ql-install`. Then run `make ql-check` again to verify the installation.

## It works on my computer

I've tested piccolo on:

- macOS 15.3.2+, SBCL 2.4.8+

## Troubleshooting

- I can't see the item type icons/emojis (i.e. file, folder, etc.).

In Ubuntu, I was able to fix this with `apt get fonts-noto-color-emoji` and restarting the terminal.

On macOS, I use iTerm2 and have not encountered any issues with emoji support.

This [article](https://linuxjedi.co.uk/rendering-emoji-in-linux-terminals/) has more information on how to fix things in Fedora/CentOS.
